DNA LLM

ToDo:

1. De-duplication - **Update** Minihash deduplication doesnt work. FCGR works better, however the current plan is to deduplicate based on species
2. Pretraining with GPT-NeoX - **Update** Transformer models are too memory intensive for long sequences. SSMs or wavelet based models may be a better fit.  
3. Create a description - sequence dataset. This will allow us to create a chat like model for creating sequences based on description. An SSM model trained on multimodel datasets can then be finetuned on D-S dataset.
4. Model scaling scripts
