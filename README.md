DNA LLM

ToDo:

1. De-duplication - Minihash deduplication doesnt work. FCGR works better in this domain. 
2. Pretraining with GPT-NeoX -Transformer model is too memory intensive for long sequences. SSM may be a better fit 
3. Description - Sequence dataset - essentially a chat model for sequences. SSM model trained on multimodel datasets, finetuned on D-S dataset.
4. Scalable scripts - PL
